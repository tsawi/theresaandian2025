        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>We met in Fort Lee, a New Jersey suburb across the George Washington Bridge from Manhattan. We lived only a mile away from each other! Theresa was in her last year of graduate school, Ian was selling health insurance. We met on a dating app and knew at once that we had swiped right on someone special.
        <br><br> Ian: "By the end of our first date I had already fallen for Theresa. She's the perfect combination of brains, beauty and sardonic wit. It took just a few weeks of dating to feel a deep togetherness and I knew I'd follow her anywhere. Moving out to California with her has been a dream come true! Since starting our journey together I've been endlessly impressed by her dedication to seismology and following her from the last few months of graduate school all the way to a job at the USGS has been amazing to watch! The last year has been filled with so much joy and adventure and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. I couldn't think of a better partner to spend the rest of my life with!"
      <br><br> Theresa: "I was immediately attracted to Ian's good look and style, as well as his acerbic humor. But what made me know he was incredibly special was his deep patience and compassion towards those around him, either by helping people prepare for the worst days of their lives through acquiring insurance, or by his constant reminders that I was beautiful and intelligent. As I was finishing graduate school and planning to move back to California, we agreed that we didn't want this to end. He took the plunge by moving West with me, and since then every day with him has been a blessing. He's a perfect partner and wonderful papa to our rescue dog Prince. We're getting married in Vegas but I already hit the jackpot -- meeting Ian was the luckiest event of my life!"</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
        <p>Events will be centered around South Las Vegas Strip, where the famous action takes place! The wedding party is staying at the Cosmopolitan. After getting RSVPs, we'll reserve blocks of rooms at hotels on or near the South end of the strip and email you with details. Reserve early; Memorial Day books up quickly!

    <img src="photos/07.jpg" alt="Need to Know">
    <div>
        <h2>Need to Know</h2>
        <p><b>Dress Code</b>: Cocktail attire, top layer recommended as it will be hot outside but A/C inside<br>
          <b>Transportation</b>: All locations are on the strip about ~10-20 min walking distance from the Cosmopolitan. Ride apps are handy, but they only pick you up in certain locations, typically outside hotel lobbies and casino entrances. <br>
          <b>Weather</b>: Hot! Think 90's. But inside has A/C, so, again, bring a top layer.<br>
